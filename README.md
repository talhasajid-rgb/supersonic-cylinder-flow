# Supersonic Flow Around a Cylinder: Numerical Study Using OpenFOAM & ANSYS Fluent

A computational fluid dynamics investigation of 2D supersonic compressible flow around a circular cylinder at Mach 1.7 and 3.0. This project implements both commercial (ANSYS Fluent) and open-source (OpenFOAM) solvers to study shock formation, standoff distance, and wake development, validating against the Sinclair & Cui theoretical model.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive CFD investigation completed as part of the "Modeling with Open Source Software" course at Skoltech. The study focuses on:

- **Dual Solver Implementation**: ANSYS Fluent (commercial) and OpenFOAM (open-source)
- **Mach Numbers**: 1.7 and 3.0 supersonic flow conditions
- **Governing Equations**: 2D inviscid Euler equations
- **Validation**: Comparison with Sinclair & Cui (2017) theoretical model

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Reproduce numerical setup from Sinclair & Cui (2017)
2. Solve 2D compressible inviscid Euler equations
3. Capture detached bow shock structure and shock standoff distance
4. Compare solver performance and validate against theoretical predictions
