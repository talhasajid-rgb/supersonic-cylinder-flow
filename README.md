# Supersonic Flow Around a Circular Cylinder  
### Numerical Study Using OpenFOAM & ANSYS Fluent

This repository presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigation of **2D inviscid supersonic flow** around a circular cylinder at freestream Mach numbers **1.7** and **3.0**. Both a commercial solver (**ANSYS Fluent**) and an open-source solver (**OpenFOAM**) are used to analyze bow shock formation, shock standoff distance, and wake development. Numerical predictions are compared with the theoretical model of **Sinclair & Cui (2017)**.


##  Project Overview

This work was completed as part of the *Modeling with Open Source Software* course at Skoltech. The study focuses on:

- **Dual-Solver Implementation**: ANSYS Fluent (commercial) and OpenFOAM (open-source)
- **Supersonic Flow Regimes**: Mach 1.7 and Mach 3.0
- **Governing Equations**: 2D inviscid **Euler equations**
- **Validation Goal**: Compare CFD results with the theoretical model of Sinclair & Cui (2017)

The simulations capture key high-speed aerodynamic features including the detached bow shock, stagnation region, subsonic pocket, and compressible wake.


##  Objectives

1. Reproduce the numerical setup described in Sinclair & Cui (2017)  
2. Solve the 2D compressible inviscid Euler equations using two independent solvers  
3. Predict the **shock standoff distance** for M = 1.7 and M = 3.0  
4. Compare ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM numerical performance  
5. Validate CFD predictions against theoretical and analytical results
