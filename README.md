# supersonic-cylinder-flow
A computational fluid dynamics investigation of 2D supersonic compressible flow around a circular cylinder at Mach 1.7 and 3.0. This project implements both commercial (ANSYS Fluent) and open-source (OpenFOAM) solvers to study shock formation, standoff distance, and wake development.
